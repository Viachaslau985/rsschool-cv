<p>My goal is to reach heights in the IT sphere. I want to become a professional in IT. Experience in this sphere is very small. I hope I can finish RSSchool.
I have a little knowledge of GitHub, HTML, CSS, simple algorithms.
No code examples yet, but I train in typing code.
This is my first IT course. Before that, I worked in a different specialty. I decided to change my job and therefore came to you for IT courses.
